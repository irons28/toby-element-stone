                <p>Inside, a young, energentic boy named <strong>Toby</strong> stood excitedly, eyes wide with anticipation.  His dad, Ben, was the greatest video game maker in the world.</p>

                <p>Toby loved watching his dad work, and more than anything, he wanted to become a video game maker just like him.</p>

                <h1>The legend of the Stone</h1>
                <p>One day, Toby heard whispers of an ancient golden gem hidden deep in the wilds - <strong>the Element Stone</strong>.  But it wasn't just any magical relic.  The Element Stone was said to grant any pwer to its holder - not just the power of elements like fire, air, or water, but any power imaginable.</p>
                <p>Curious and determined, Toby decided to find it.</p>

                <p>He packed his essentials:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A machine that could turn anything into a delicious meal</li>
                    <li>An auto re-fillable bottle of fresh water</li>
                    <li>A trusty sword</li>
                    <li>A tent and a soft bedroll</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As night fell over <strong>Elementville</strong>, Toby set off under the stars</p>

                <p>Partway through his journey, Toby faced his first great challenge - a <strong>giant scorpion</strong> guarding a rocky path.</p>
                <p>With no time to hesitate, Toby charged with his sword in hand!</p>
                <p>The scorpion swung its massive claws, and readied his tail to sting, but Toby was quick.</p>
                <p>He dodged, then struck</p>
                <p>With one final move, he stabbed the beast, and it vanished in a puff of sand.</p>

                <p>At last, Toby reached the final gate where the <strong>Element Stone</strong> was siad to rest.  A mysterious challenge appeared: a 1-on-1 football match against a strange machine opponent.</p>
                <p>At first, Toby tried to use fancy tricks - but the machine read every move.  Then Toby noticed something: the walls.</p>
                <p>He struck the ball against the walls at sharp angles...</p>
                <p>Then he ran the other way to meet the ball, then scored.</p>
                <p>it worked!</p>
                <p>The machine missed completely, and Toby won the match.</p>

                <p>A golden gate opened, glowing brighter than the sun.  Toby stepped through and found himself instantly teleported home.</p>
                <p>As he arrived, animals greeted him warmly, birds singing and foxes circling his feet.</p>
                <p>In his pocket, the <strong>Element Stone</strong> glowed faintly - ready to grant any power he could imagine.</p>
                <p>Maybe today it would help him build games like his dad.</p>
                <p>Maybe tomorrow, it would take him on another quest.</p>
                <p>Either way, Toby's journey had only just begun.</p>
